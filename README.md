# The Three Teds

This website showcases the food items that The Three Ted's offer in Stradbally, County Waterford.  The website shows images of the the different offerings, shares reviews from existing customers to give new customers a feel for what The Three Teds can provide.  It also introduces Natalie, Rob and Mark to give background to ensure that the new customer will have full confidence that what they order will exceed their expectations. The details including costs of the different offerings are laid out so that the customer has all the information needed to make a decision. Finally they have an opportunity to contact The three teds for the final transaction.

I went with the same fonts as Love Running, but it is something I might revisit if I have time.
I used this video on CSS grid to help me with the product section of the home page CSS Grid Tutorial: Responsive Design Examples.
